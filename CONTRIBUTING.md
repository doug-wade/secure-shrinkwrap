This is a really quick and dirty response to a security vulnerability that was
disclosed earlier than expected, so I have not had the time to fully consider
the problem domain and put together a well-tested, well-considered, vetted
solution.  Instead, I've thrown together something quick, and documented the
issues that I know of in this repository, so that we have something to start
working against and collaborating on.  As such, any contributions -- issues,
prs, comments, anything -- are actively solicited and welcomed.  Don't be a
jerk to other people if you're contributing, or your contributions will no
longer be welcomed.
